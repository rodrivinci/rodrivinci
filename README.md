### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**rodrivinci/rodrivinci** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ğŸ”­ I am currently working at a Toyota car dealership
- ğŸŒ± I am currently learning data science at DNC â€‹â€‹school and studying the 4th year of the information system course at EstÃ¡cio de Sa College
- ğŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on data analysis, data science and dashboard creation projects
- ğŸ¤” I'm looking for help with a specialization in Data Science
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about management processes, post-sales process routine at a car dealership, soft skills
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Email and Messaging App
- âš¡With 30 years of experience, I have worked in several areas in after-sales, and today I seek to apply this knowledge to learn in an area that I have always identified with, which is data analysis, because those who don't measure don't manage
